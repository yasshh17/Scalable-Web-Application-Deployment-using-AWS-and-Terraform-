# 🏗️ Scalable Web Application Infrastructure on AWS (Terraform)

This project demonstrates how to deploy a secure, highly available, and auto-scalable web application infrastructure on **AWS** using **Terraform**. It includes a custom VPC, EC2 instances, an Application Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, Amazon RDS, and CloudWatch monitoring — all managed through Infrastructure as Code.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🧩 Custom **VPC** with 3 public and 2 private subnets across multiple availability zones
- 🔐 **Amazon RDS** deployed in private subnets with restricted access
- ⚙️ **EC2 instances** launched via Launch Templates in public subnets
- 🌐 **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** routing HTTP traffic with health checks
- 📈 **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** with CloudWatch alarms for CPU-based scaling
- 🧪 **Health checks** and API validation for real-time monitoring and zero downtime
